# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Step 1: Make Changes to Your Code
Open your project files in your code editor (e.g., VS Code).
Edit or add your code as needed.
Step 2: Stage the Changes
Once you've made changes, you need to stage them, which means telling Git which changes to include in the next commit.

Open your terminal and navigate to your project folder (if you're not already there):
cd /path/to/himalayaPlast
To see which files have been modified, you can run:
git status
To stage all changes (including new, modified, and deleted files):
git add .
This stages all the changes.

Alternatively, you can stage specific files by specifying their names:

git add path/to/file1 path/to/file2
Step 3: Commit the Changes
After staging the changes, you need to commit them, which saves the changes to your local Git repository.

Commit the staged changes with a message describing what you did:
git commit -m "Your commit message describing the changes"
Example:

git commit -m "Fixed bug in homepage layout"
Step 4: Push the Changes to GitHub
Once you've committed your changes, you need to push them to the remote GitHub repository to reflect the changes online.

To push the changes to the remote repository, run:
git push origin main
(If you are using the master branch, use master instead of main.)
Step 5: Verify the Changes
Go to your GitHub repository in the browser.
Verify that the changes are reflected there.
Summary of Commands:
Stage all changes:
git add .
Commit changes:
git commit -m "Your message"
Push to GitHub:
git push origin main
That's it! Let me know if you need more clarification!
